# Q&A Chatbot using OpenAI's Language Model
This is a simple question-answering chatbot built using OpenAI's GPT-3.5 language model. The chatbot takes a user's input question and provides a response using the trained language model.

# Technologies Used
Python
Streamlit
OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Language Model
dotenv
# Setup
Clone the repository:

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
```
Install the required Python packages:

``` bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Create a .env file in the root directory of your project and add your OpenAI API key:

env
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```
Run the Streamlit app:
``` bash
streamlit run app.py
```
# How to Use
Enter your question in the "Input" text box.
Click the "Ask the question" button to get the response.
The chatbot will display the response below the input box.

#Notes
Make sure to keep your OpenAI API key secure and do not share it publicly.
This is a basic implementation. You can further enhance the chatbot by adding more features and improving the response generation logic.
